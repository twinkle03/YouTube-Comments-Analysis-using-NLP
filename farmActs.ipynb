Keeping in view the importance of agriculture, the States have enacted the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Acts to develop market-yard as market place and to provide regulation on marketing practices of notified agricultural produce. However, the regulatory provisions hindered the freedom of choice-based marketing and also the inflow of investment in development of alternative markets and marketing infrastructure.\n",
    "2.\tThe Government of India had circulated the Model APMC Act, 2003 and the Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitating) Act, 2017 to the States to reform their APMC Acts with a view to increase competitiveness in agriculture supply chain, provide freedom to farmers to sell their produce through alternative marketing channels to get the fair prices through the market framework under the State legislations. However, the States have not embraced the reforms in a uniform manner, and the lack of homogeneity in the laws has been obstructing a competitive pricing environment for the farmers and is becoming an impediment to the evolution of a modern trading system.\n",
    "3.\tAgriculture not only meets the food security requirements of the country, but also provides raw material to the agro-industry which culminates into job creation and earning of foreign exchange through export. Directly linking the agro-industry with the farmers shortens the supply chain, reduces the marketing cost and post-harvest losses and most importantly enhances farmers’ income.\n",
    "4.\tTo keep pace with the dynamically changing agri-economy, e-commerce and agri-exports and also to meet the rising expectations of farmers and consumers, the country needs an accessible and competitive trading system outside the physical space of the notified market-yards under the State APMC Acts.\n",
    "5.\tIn the light of above circumstances, it has become necessary to enact a Central Legislation to provide a more competitive and hassle free eco-system where farmers and traders have the choice to sell their produce in an efficient, transparent and competitive environment to realise remunerative prices. However, as Parliament was not in session and an urgent legislation was required to be made, the President promulgated the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020 (Ord. 10 of 2020) under clause (1) of article 123 of the Constitution on the 5th day of June, 2020.\n",
    "6.\tThe Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 which seeks to replace the aforesaid Ordinance, inter alia, provides for the following, namely:—\n",
    "(a)\tfreedom of choice to the farmer or trader to conduct trade and commerce in a trade area;\n",
    "(b)\tno trader shall be allowed to trade in a scheduled farmers’ produce unless such a trader has a permanent account number or such other documents as may be notified by the Central Government;\n",
    "(c)\tto allow any person or any farmer producer organisation or primary agricultural cooperative society to establish and operate an electronic trading and transaction platform for facilitating inter-State and intra-State trade and commerce of a scheduled farmers’ produce;\n",
    "(d)\tno market fee or cess shall be levied on any farmer or trader or electronic trading and transaction platform for trade and commerce in scheduled farmers’produce in a trade area;\n",

    "(e)\ta dispute resolution mechanism in case of disputes between the farmers and traders; and\n",
    "(f)\tto enable the Central Government to develop a “Price Information and Market Intelligence System” for farmers’ produce and a framework for dissemination of such information;\n",

Sub-clause (2) of said clause provides that such rules may provide for—(a) the system of electronic registration for a trader and modalities of trade transaction of scheduled farmers’ produce under sub-section (2) of section 4; (b) the procedure of payment under proviso to sub-section (3) of section 4; (c) the manner and procedure for filing a petition or an application before the Sub-divisional Authority and appeal before the appellate authority under sub-section (10) of section 8; (d) the information regarding transactions under sub-section (2) of section 9;\n",
